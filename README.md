# Building Git

Learning about Git by following "Building Git" book.

The book uses `Jit` as the name for the learning implementation of Git, but I'm going to use `Kit`. It's a multi-language pun:
- `kit` in English as `arrangement`/`accessory` (e.g. toolkit)
- `kit` in Polish as `putty`
- `kit` in Polish as `excuse`/`claptrap`

I think it fits pretty well in both languages. Also helps with naming clashes.
